# Code Exam #2 Outline

Goal: Use Code Exam #2 requirement to begin the initial development of an eventual art exhibition to be displayed over the coming year. This portion will consist of the development of one specific project that will make use of the DukeMTMC dataset. 

## Proposal 

DukeMTMC (Multi-Target, Multi-Camera) dataset, a large scale database of images captured by researchers in Duke’s Computer Science Department using Duke’s surveillance camera system in 2014, was previously one of the largest and most frequently used datasets for video re-identification, a process that uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to identify and track targeted individuals within live video feeds. Duke researchers claim that the project, funded by the US Army Research Office and National Science Foundation, was originally intended to improve systems for motion detection of objects in video, regardless of “whether [the objects] are people, cars, fish or other” (Dr. Carlo Tomasi, source Duke Chronicle), but was available for download on the Duke Computer Vision research website. The dataset has recently been taken down, after it came under fire in April 2019 for ethical and privacy violations following an expose by researcher Adam Harvey that prompted Duke’s Institutional Review Board to revisit the terms of the collection and use of the image data. Investigation reveals that the collection and making public of the data (1) indicates a “significant deviation from the [IRB] approved protocol” (Michael Schoenfeld) and (2) the dataset has irreversibly been downloaded and implemented in computer vision, body tracking, and facial recognition systems by academic, governmental and military institutions across the globe. Significantly, this dataset has been traced to research papers published by Chinese companies SenseNets and SenseTime Group Limited, both associated with contributing to the surveillance techniques used by the Chinese military to target and monitor Uyghur populations in rural China. As Harvey points out, this implementation isn’t all that different from the original motivation of the Duke researchers, who published a subsequent paper in 2017 titled “Tracking Social Groups Within and Across Cameras.” When scrolling through the dataset, which contains images of students entering and leaving academic buildings and places of worship, one might see how this information could easily be weaponized to target and discriminate against marked individuals. In Harvey’s analysis, this is but one example of “an egregious prioritization of surveillance technologies over individual rights” (Megapixels).
